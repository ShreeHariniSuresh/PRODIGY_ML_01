# Linear Regression model to predict the prices of houses 
This repository contains code on Linear Regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms with the dataset from Kaggle [Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).
## Description
Addressing real-world challenges, forecasting housing costs is a pivotal issue. Leveraging machine learning, this project endeavors to tackle the problem by delving into the realm of regression techniques. The objective is to analyze the dataset's features and ascertain the most precise model through Linear Regression Model.
